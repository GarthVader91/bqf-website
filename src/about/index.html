                What is Bible Quizzing
            </h1>
            <p>
                Bible quizzing is an exciting way to get students into the Word of God, and thus the Word of God into students. With a rotating schedule of material, quizzers are exposed to a large percentage of the New Testament. Competing locally and nationally, quizzers typically memorize seven or more chapters of scripture each season, and in competition learn how to work as a team, think on their feet, and handle pressure.
